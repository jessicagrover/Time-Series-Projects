The repository contains a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 time series data for different countries, aiming to forecast confirmed cases using statistical models. The project is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis.

Firstly, the data is retrieved using the COVID19 package, and then transformed into a time series format using the tsibble package. The visualization section provides insights into the trend of confirmed cases over time for selected countries, facilitating a comparative analysis of COVID-19 spread dynamics.

The modeling section employs both linear and exponential smoothing (ETS) models to forecast future confirmed cases. Each model is evaluated for diagnostic accuracy through residual analysis, providing insights into model performance and potential areas for improvement.

Finally, the forecasting section generates forecasts for future confirmed cases, offering valuable insights into the trajectory of COVID-19 spread in the selected countries. Visualizations accompany the forecasts, aiding in the interpretation and understanding of the model predictions.

Overall, the project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and predicting the spread of COVID-19 using time series analysis techniques. The combination of data visualization, modeling, and forecasting provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing pandemic data, with potential applications in public health policy and decision-making.
